   <h2> Ingredients:
    
   </h2>
   <ol>
<li>Potatoes (russet or Idaho are good choices)</li>
<li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
<li>Salt to taste </li>
</ol> 


<h2>Instructions:</h2>


Peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized sticks, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.<br>
Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch. This helps in achieving a crispier fry.<br>

Cook the toor dal in a pressure cooker with enough water until soft and mushy.<br>
In a separate pot, heat oil and add mustard seeds. Let them splutter.<br>
Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Saute for a few seconds.<br>
Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels.<br>
Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large pot to around 350°F (175°C).<br>
Carefully add the potatoes to the hot oil in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the fryer or pot. Fry for about 5-7 minutes or until they are golden brown and crispy.<br>
Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon or tongs and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
Sprinkle the fries with salt while they are still hot.<br>
Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade French fries!
<br>

Note: Be cautious when working with hot oil and never leave it unattended<br>
