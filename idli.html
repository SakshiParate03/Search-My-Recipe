<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<h2>For Idli:</h2>

Wash and soak the idli rice and urad dal separately for 4-6 hours.<br>
Grind the soaked urad dal to a smooth batter consistency using some water.
Transfer it to a large bowl.<br>
Grind the soaked rice to a slightly coarse texture. Add this to the bowl with the urad dal
batter.<br>
Add salt to the batter and mix well. Allow it to ferment overnight or for 8-10 hours.<br>
Grease the idli molds with oil and pour the batter into them. Steam in an idli steamer for
about 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the idlis comes out clean.
Remove from heat and set aside.<br>
<h2>For Sambhar:</h2>

Cook the toor dal in a pressure cooker with enough water until soft and mushy.<br>
In a separate pot, heat oil and add mustard seeds. Let them splutter.<br>
Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Saute for a few seconds.<br>
Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent.<br>
Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until tomatoes are soft.<br>
Add chopped vegetables, tamarind paste, sambhar powder, and salt. Mix well.<br>
Add water as needed to cover the vegetables and let it come to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer
until vegetables are cooked through.<br>
Once the vegetables are cooked, add the cooked toor dal and mix well. Adjust the consistency
by adding more water if necessary.<br>
Let the sambhar simmer for a few more minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.<br>
Garnish with fresh coriander leaves before serving.<br>
Serve hot idlis with piping hot sambhar for a delicious and comforting meal.
You can also serve with coconut chutney for extra flavor. 
Enjoy your homemade Idli Sambhar!<br>
